2026-02-15 03:14:54 [INFO] Queued for approval: Add a hard constraint that prevents stakes >$2 without explicit manual approval in code. Log all stake changes with timestamp and reason.
2026-02-15 03:14:54 [INFO] Queued for approval: Investigate why Hybrid bot has zero trades in paper mode. Verify scout trigger logic (13:10, 13:30, 13:45) and big-bet logic (14:00) are executing correctly. Check for order placement failures or timing issues.
2026-02-15 03:14:54 [INFO] Queued for approval: Reduce upper entry bound from 90% to 87%. Trade 75 (0.905 entry) is above the sweet spot and represents the kind of high-conviction, low-reward trade that fails at current stake levels.
