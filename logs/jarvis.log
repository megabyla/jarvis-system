2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Add technical enforcement: stakes must equal $2.00 exactly. Remove all soft rule overrides. Lock at code level, not config.
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Manually reset all $5 and $10 stakes to $2.00 for trades 71-80. Recalculate P&L impact.
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Review code that allows stakes to deviate from $2.00. Identify what triggered the override in trades 71-80. Was it manual intervention, a bug, or a config reload?
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Keep 80-90% sweet spot active. Entry discipline is working. Trade 77 at 78.5% lost as expected (below range).
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Hybrid bot has zero trades in paper mode. Verify scout trigger times (13:10, 13:30, 13:45) and big-bet logic (14:00) are firing. Check logs for missed signals.

2026-02-15 15:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Deploy code-level constraint that prevents ANY trade with stake > $2.00. Remove all soft rules and manual reversion options. Make this a hard circuit breaker in the execution layer.
2026-02-15 15:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Halt all Sharbel trading immediately. Do not resume until hard stake lock is verified in code and tested with 5+ live trades at $2 baseline.

2026-02-16 03:15:10 [INFO] Queued for approval: Implement hard technical lock on stakes at $2.00 maximum. Block any trade execution if stake > $2.00. This must execute BEFORE next trade.
