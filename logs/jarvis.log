2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Add technical enforcement: stakes must equal $2.00 exactly. Remove all soft rule overrides. Lock at code level, not config.
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Manually reset all $5 and $10 stakes to $2.00 for trades 71-80. Recalculate P&L impact.
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Review code that allows stakes to deviate from $2.00. Identify what triggered the override in trades 71-80. Was it manual intervention, a bug, or a config reload?
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Keep 80-90% sweet spot active. Entry discipline is working. Trade 77 at 78.5% lost as expected (below range).
2026-02-15 09:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Hybrid bot has zero trades in paper mode. Verify scout trigger times (13:10, 13:30, 13:45) and big-bet logic (14:00) are firing. Check logs for missed signals.

2026-02-15 15:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Deploy code-level constraint that prevents ANY trade with stake > $2.00. Remove all soft rules and manual reversion options. Make this a hard circuit breaker in the execution layer.
2026-02-15 15:15:02 [INFO] Queued for approval: Halt all Sharbel trading immediately. Do not resume until hard stake lock is verified in code and tested with 5+ live trades at $2 baseline.

2026-02-16 07:55:39 [INFO] Queued for approval: Deploy technical hard lock on stake parameter. Set maximum allowed stake to $2.00 in code. Disable all soft reversion rules and replace with immutable code constraint.
2026-02-16 07:55:39 [INFO] Queued for approval: Debug trade execution pipeline for race conditions. Trades 96-97 (BTC DOWN, entry 0.835) and 98-99 (ETH UP, entry 0.795) are identical duplicates with timestamps 306ms apart. Verify: (1) Are these duplicate executions or data logging errors? (2) Is the order submission system creating race conditions? (3) Should duplicates be auto-rejected or merged?
2026-02-16 07:55:39 [INFO] Queued for approval: Once hard stake lock is deployed, execute immediate reversion to $2 baseline stakes. This will convert the current 82% win rate into +$18-22 P&L per 50-trade cycle (vs. current -$23.49).
2026-02-16 07:55:39 [INFO] Queued for approval: Hybrid bot has executed zero trades in paper mode despite 48+ hours of operation. Verify: (1) Are scout triggers firing at 13:10, 13:30, 13:45? (2) Is big-bet trigger firing at 14:00? (3) Are fill assumptions (85% paper, 60-70% live) realistic? (4) Is the BTC-only asset filter too restrictive?

2026-02-16 08:00:16 [INFO] Queued for approval: Implement database-level constraint: stakes table has CHECK constraint (stake = 2.00 ONLY). No application logic, no soft rules. Hard constraint at storage layer.
2026-02-16 08:00:16 [INFO] Queued for approval: Debug race condition causing duplicate trade records. IDs 96-97 and 98-99 have identical timestamps (millisecond precision), identical entry prices, identical movements, identical stakes. Check: (1) concurrent write locks in trade execution, (2) logging pipeline for duplicates, (3) webhook retry logic.
2026-02-16 08:00:16 [INFO] Queued for approval: Test that bot is reading latest configuration on startup. Run: (1) change stakes to $2 in config file, (2) restart bot, (3) verify next trade uses $2, (4) check logs for config load timestamp. If bot is reading stale config, this explains all 6 violations.
2026-02-16 08:00:16 [INFO] Queued for approval: Halt Sharbel live trading until hard stake lock is deployed and verified. Paper mode only until fixes are confirmed.
2026-02-16 08:00:16 [INFO] Queued for approval: Hybrid has zero trades in paper mode as of 2/16 02:59 UTC. Scout times are 13:10, 13:30, 13:45 into window; big bet at 14:00. Check: (1) are scout triggers firing? (2) are fill assumptions (85% paper vs 60-70% live) correct? (3) is big-bet logic executing?
2026-02-16 08:00:42 [INFO] User approved: Add a rule to memory: 'Stake changes require explicit log entry with timestamp and reason. Auto-flag any deviation from baseline within 24 hours.'

2026-02-16 08:01:03 [INFO] User approved: Add technical enforcement: stakes must equal $2.00 exactly. Remove all soft rule overrides. Lock at code level, not config.

2026-02-16 08:01:15 [INFO] User rejected: Keep 80-90% sweet spot active. Entry discipline is working. Trade 77 at 78.5% lost as expected (below range).

2026-02-16 08:01:23 [INFO] User approved: Deploy code-level constraint that prevents ANY trade with stake > $2.00. Remove all soft rules and manual reversion options. Make this a hard circuit breaker in the execution layer.

2026-02-16 08:01:26 [INFO] User rejected: Halt all Sharbel trading immediately. Do not resume until hard stake lock is verified in code and tested with 5+ live trades at $2 baseline.
2026-02-16 08:01:29 [INFO] User rejected: Investigate why Hybrid bot has zero trades in paper mode despite running for 24+ hours. Verify that scout times (13:10, 13:30, 13:45) and big-bet logic (14:00) are firing correctly. Check logs for trigger conditions and order placement.
2026-02-16 08:01:31 [INFO] User rejected: Deploy technical hard lock on Sharbel stakes at $2.00 maximum. Remove all soft rule enforcement. Make $2 the only allowed stake value in code.
2026-02-16 08:01:34 [INFO] User approved: Analyze why trades 84, 85, 77 lost despite 0.2% movement filter. All three had movement <0.26% and entry >0.78. Movement filter should have rejected these or win rate should have been higher.

2026-02-16 08:01:40 [INFO] User rejected: Verify that Hybrid bot's scout trigger logic is executing at scheduled times (13:10, 13:30, 13:45 UTC). Add logging to confirm trigger fires and big-bet logic at 14:00.
2026-02-16 08:01:42 [INFO] User rejected: Implement hard technical lock on stakes at $2.00 maximum. Block any trade execution if stake > $2.00. This must execute BEFORE next trade.
2026-02-16 08:01:44 [INFO] User approved: Review trades 96 and 97 (both timestamp 2026-02-16T02:59:02.xxx, identical entry/movement/stake). Determine if this is a system bug or intentional retry logic.

2026-02-16 08:01:52 [INFO] User rejected: Deploy technical hard lock on stake parameter. Set maximum allowed stake to $2.00 in code. Disable all soft reversion rules and replace with immutable code constraint.
2026-02-16 08:01:59 [INFO] User rejected: Once hard stake lock is deployed, execute immediate reversion to $2 baseline stakes. This will convert the current 82% win rate into +$18-22 P&L per 50-trade cycle (vs. current -$23.49).
2026-02-16 08:02:03 [INFO] User rejected: Hybrid bot has executed zero trades in paper mode despite 48+ hours of operation. Verify: (1) Are scout triggers firing at 13:10, 13:30, 13:45? (2) Is big-bet trigger firing at 14:00? (3) Are fill assumptions (85% paper, 60-70% live) realistic? (4) Is the BTC-only asset filter too restrictive?
2026-02-16 08:02:10 [INFO] User rejected: Implement database-level constraint: stakes table has CHECK constraint (stake = 2.00 ONLY). No application logic, no soft rules. Hard constraint at storage layer.
2026-02-16 08:02:12 [INFO] User approved: Debug race condition causing duplicate trade records. IDs 96-97 and 98-99 have identical timestamps (millisecond precision), identical entry prices, identical movements, identical stakes. Check: (1) concurrent write locks in trade execution, (2) logging pipeline for duplicates, (3) webhook retry logic.

2026-02-16 08:02:18 [INFO] User rejected: Test that bot is reading latest configuration on startup. Run: (1) change stakes to $2 in config file, (2) restart bot, (3) verify next trade uses $2, (4) check logs for config load timestamp. If bot is reading stale config, this explains all 6 violations.
2026-02-16 08:02:22 [INFO] User rejected: Halt Sharbel live trading until hard stake lock is deployed and verified. Paper mode only until fixes are confirmed.
2026-02-16 08:02:24 [INFO] User rejected: Hybrid has zero trades in paper mode as of 2/16 02:59 UTC. Scout times are 13:10, 13:30, 13:45 into window; big bet at 14:00. Check: (1) are scout triggers firing? (2) are fill assumptions (85% paper vs 60-70% live) correct? (3) is big-bet logic executing?

2026-02-16 13:23:58 [INFO] Queued for approval: Debug the trade logging pipeline. Check for: (1) race conditions in order submission, (2) duplicate writes to trade log, (3) timestamp precision issues, (4) async callback handlers firing twice.
2026-02-16 13:23:58 [INFO] Queued for approval: Test that configuration changes (stake reductions, filter adjustments) are actually being read by the bot at execution time. Add logging to confirm config values at trade submission.
